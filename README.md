# Create Your Own Chatbot Website with Open Source LLMs

Chatbots use a special kind of computer program called a transformer, which is like its brain. Inside this brain, there is something called a language model (LLM), which helps the chatbot understand and generate human-like responses. It looks at lots of examples of human conversations it has seen before to help it respond in a way that makes sense.

## Learning Objectives

- The main components of a chatbot
- What an LLM is
- How to choose an LLM for your application
- How a transformer essentially works
- How to feed input into a transformer (tokenization)
- How to program your own simple chatbot in Python


## Lessons Learned

The key is that the LLM learns from a large amount of text data to understand language patterns and generate meaningful responses. The transformer helps with the technical aspects of processing and representing the input/output data, allowing the LLM to focus on understanding and generating language.\
